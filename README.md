# homebridge-meteobridge
A pretty basic plugin for Homebridge to display Temperature and Humidity for [meteobridge-](https://www.meteobridge.com/wiki/index.php/Home)connected weatherstations.  Currenlty the plugin relies on your locally-connected meteobridge to relay and display weather station data (temperature and humidity) to the Home App.

**Special Note:** As with most things in HomeKit, you can ask Siri on your iOS (or HomePod) device to read out the temp and/or humidity based on how you setup your devices in the Home App.

## Quick Installation

1. Install homebridge using: **_npm install -g homebridge_**
2. Install this plugin using: **_npm install -g homebridge-meteobridge_**
3. Update your configuration file to reflect your local conditions (**see the sample below**)

No keys or APIs required.  We just rely on the fact that **(a)** you have a weather station on your local networtk connected through a Meteobridge and **(b)** Meteobridge exposes templates for us to take advantage of.

#### Credits
This plugin was heavily influenced by the Thorsten VoÃŸ's [homebridge-wunderground](https://github.com/xfjx/homebridge-wunderground) work.  With Wunderground likely becoming inaccessible as a free service in teh not-so-distant future, I chose to make this "local" version for people to use (if they have a Meteobridge-connected weather station, of course).
